<em>Meanings interpreted:</em><br>
The symbols in Whorten's coat of arms harmonize with our values and beliefs.  Symbols for courage (the lions and the unicorn) represent the courage of Whorten students to pursue higher education.  Purple (sovereignty) symbolizes our students taking charge of their own destiny, and pays tribute to the individual spirit so esteemed by the Academy.  The oak branches symbolize the great age and strength of the educational institutions that have come before us. Finally, symbols for peace and wisdom represent the cooperative community of devoted learners we strive to create.
